# 📘 Project Statement: Instagram Caption Generator

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered web application that generates creative and engaging Instagram captions automatically based on the user’s input description and mood.

## 🧠 Description
This project combines **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and the **OpenAI API** to build an interactive caption generator.  
Users can enter a short description of their Instagram post, select the mood (like Funny, Romantic, or Professional), and the app will instantly generate a caption using an AI model.  

The app also includes:
- A **mock fallback system** that generates sample captions offline when no API key is available.
- **Error handling** for API rate limits or connection issues.
- A **simple and responsive front-end** designed with HTML and CSS.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Flask**
- **HTML & CSS**
- **Jinja2 Templates**
- **OpenAI API**
- **python-dotenv**

## 🚀 Key Features
- AI-based caption generation  
- Secure environment variable handling  
- Offline mock caption mode  
- Error and rate limit handling  
- Responsive and clean front-end design  

## 📈 Outcome
This project demonstrates the integration of artificial intelligence with web development.  
It helped in understanding how to connect backend logic with an AI API and how to design an intuitive, modern web interface for end-users.
